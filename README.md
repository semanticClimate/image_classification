Description: 

In this notebook, we fine-tune a pretrained ViT on the Fashion Products Small dataset from Hugging Face, which contains 42,700 e-commerce images of apparel and accessories (e.g., shirts, watches) along with metadata. The data is split into training, validation, and testing. Rather than training from scratch, the notebook uses ViT-Base-Patch16-224-in21k from Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers library.
